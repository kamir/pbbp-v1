# Overview

In this folder we keep and manage the used assistance systems as submodules from Github.

We can add more and more assistance modules over time.

Initially we have the "OPI-BOT-PoC" and in Mirko's version also a clone of "demo-1". But this is already an example for different evolutionary paths going forward. 

The source code repositories are used in the beginning. Later we expect that each module comes with a Dockerfile and a script for container based deployments using K8S.
