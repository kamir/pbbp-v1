This document describes how we create a new Personal Bot instance from a Personal Bot BluePrint project as provided in this repository.

The primary goal of this task is the creation of an instance on a computer,
using source code and Github so that the user can participate in early testing and development work.

  git clone https://github.com/kamir/pbbp-v1 NAME_OF_YOUR_INSTANCE
